# tdee-calc
Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) calculator made in Flask.
---

### A small Flask-app I built for trying out Flask.
#### Calcultes an estimated TDEE based on your personal stats.

The calcatulation takes into account weight, height, age, gender and activity level.

---
**Currently only uses [Mifflin St Jeor forumula](https://read.qxmd.com/read/2305711/a-new-predictive-equation-for-resting-energy-expenditure-in-healthy-individuals) for calculating RDEE**
#### TODO
- Add multiple algorithms avaible for calculating BMR, to base TDEE off.
- Reccomend different macro splits (P/C/F).
- Try out averaging multiple algorithms for better estimation of TDEE.

Do note that this is a personal project and calculated values are meant to be taken with a grains of salt.
